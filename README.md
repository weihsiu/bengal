# Bengal: Dotty Cats

This projects is just some code I put together to teach myself Scala 3 syntax.  It tries to mimic the functioanlities of functional libraries like cats/scalaz.  It is by no means complete or will it ever be.  Try it at your own peril.

## How to play with it

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Make sure 'code'(the VSCode executable) is in the execution path
3. git clone this repo and cd to it
4. sbt launchIDE
